## Project 4 - Mazes

#### Names

#### John's Ideas

Thick edges (entire black squares) or Thin edges (as one would expect for a maze)?

Have the board be concrete?

Board should be cell-centered (each cell has which edges are present)
or should it be edge-centered (one copy of each edge)?

Make the solving and generating algorithms abstract classes (maybe interfaces)?

How do we want to split work?
